## Accessibility and Semantic Decisions

#Semantic Structure:
The pages use <header><nav><main><section>and<footer>to provide clear document structure. 
This improves screen reader navigation and machine readability.

#Skip to Content Link:
A "Skip to Content" link allows keyboard users to bypass navigation and jump directly 
to the main content area.

#Proper Form Labeling:
Each input field uses a <label> element with a matching 'for' attribute linked to the input 'id'. 
This ensures screen readers correctly associate labels with form controls.

#Required Attributes:
The 'required' attribute ensures essential form fields must be completed before submission.
